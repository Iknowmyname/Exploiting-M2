# Exploiting-M2

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>There were several vulnerabilities found from the scanning the vulnerable M2 virtual machine. These vulnerabiities if exploited can cause critical cyber breaches and leak of private information. The possible exploitations will be presented to show the outcomes of these exploits.</p>

<h2>MSFConsole</h2>

MSFconsole, also known as the Metasploit Framework Console, is a powerful and widely used command-line interface (CLI) that comes with the Metasploit Framework. Metasploit is a popular open-source framework for developing, testing, and executing exploits against computer systems. It provides a collection of tools, exploits, payloads, and modules that assist security professionals and penetration testers in assessing the security of target systems.

<h4>Exploiting VSFTPD_2.3.4</h4>

<p>From scanning the Services and the Version running on the virtual machine previously with the nmap Service & Version detecttion scan, it showed a vsftpd service running with the version 2.3.4. If we search up this particular version of the vsftpd service there is a backddor exploit present which will allow us to access the root shell of the machine.</p>

</p>

<p>This exploit can be used in the msfconsole, which allows us to use the backdoor script. Once the exploit is set then the ip address of the targeted machie will be set. The we run the exploit and it will give us the root shell access.</p>

</p>

<p>To verfity the user type we can run the whoami command and it will tell us that we are currently a root user in the shell. Now we can view all the vital files of the system and also the encrypted username and password of users in system</p>

<p>This shows that a backdoor vulnerability is extremely critical and will allow malicious users to gain access to vital files in the system and also the accounts of authorized users.</p>
